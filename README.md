# LCM_image

Simulation code of the latent-class model with imaging data and survival outcomes

The repository includes the following files:

`fun_LCM.R`: The R source code contains functions for fitting the latent-class model.

`simu_EM.R`: A demo script for a simulation study of the EM algorithm.

`simu_gener_EM.R`: A demo script for a simulation study of the generalized EM algorithm.

-   Brain.Tr.rda: coordinates of triangles used to set up the simulation study.

-   Brain.V.rda: vertices of the triangles.
